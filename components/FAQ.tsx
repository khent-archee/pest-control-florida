                Yes, most escape rooms require advance booking to ensure
                availability. Popular times (evenings and weekends) often book
                up quickly. We recommend making reservations at least a few days
                in advance, especially for larger groups or popular venues.

                Comfortable clothing and closed-toe shoes are recommended. Some
                rooms may require physical activity like crawling, reaching, or
                climbing. Avoid very bulky clothing or high heels that might
                restrict movement.

                While this varies by room, 4-6 players is often ideal. This
                provides enough diverse thinking and manpower without
                overcrowding the space. Our directory notes when rooms are
                particularly suitable for larger or smaller groups.

                Most modern escape rooms are not designed to be physically
                confining, and emergency exits are always available. Our
                directory can help you find rooms with more spacious layouts. If
                you have specific concerns, we recommend contacting the venue
                directly before booking.
